Artemis Financial is a financial services company committed to empowering its customers through tailored financial plans while placing a strong emphasis on security. Ensuring that sensitive client data remains protected from unauthorized access is a top priority. I’ve played an integral role in supporting this mission by contributing directly to the company’s software security efforts.

One of my key responsibilities involved conducting dependency testing to uncover vulnerabilities in the software used by Artemis Financial. Addressing these issues is crucial for developing secure code that reduces the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. Secure, resilient software not only protects customer information but also builds trust—an essential factor in attracting and retaining clients.

During the vulnerability assessment process, one of the challenges I encountered was distinguishing genuine security threats from false positives, or non-critical alerts. To enhance the overall security posture, I implemented an SSL certificate and ensured that all data transmissions were conducted using HTTP POST methods—both recognized industry best practices.

Looking forward, my approach to vulnerability assessment includes a dual focus: identifying potential threats and effectively filtering out false positives to ensure that efforts are concentrated on legitimate security concerns. After each phase of code refactoring, I conducted repeated testing, including dependency checks, to catch any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

A particularly useful resource for improving workflow is Eclipse's built-in web browser, which streamlines the development and testing process. One of my most impactful contributions was the creation of the Vulnerability Assessment Report. This document reflects my strong capability in identifying, analyzing, and interpreting security data—an essential skill for maintaining high software security standards.
